{"name":"alias","tagline":"The simple command that I always forget to use","body":"# alias\r\n\r\nThe Unix gods created this simple command that I always forget to use.\r\n\r\nWith the recent popularity of [heroku-fucking-console](https://github.com/tpope/heroku-fucking-console), it seems that others forget it as well.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to set aliases.  Your fingers will thank you.\r\n\r\n### Which commands should I alias?\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nhistory | ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ankane/alias/master/alias.rb)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: This does not take into account current aliases (if someone knows how to do this, let me know)\r\n\r\n### What is an alias?\r\n\r\nAll day, you type:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nheroku run console\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit push\r\n```\r\n\r\nImagine a world where you could just type:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nhc\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngp\r\n```\r\n\r\nMeet aliases!  Add this to `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` if zsh is your thing)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nalias hc=\"heroku run console\"\r\nalias gp=\"git push\"\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-39027070-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
